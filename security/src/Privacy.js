        <h2>PRIVACY POLICY</h2>
        
        <p>The patented method of PerpTrac – namely, the
        utilization of technology to track unique unencrypted
        radio transmissions of mobile devices in order to
        enhance physical security surveillance by both citizens
        and law enforcement – exists as a revolutionary
        security asset that fundamentally does not violate legal
        statutes or ethical guidelines governing personal
        privacy. However, the PerpTrac system must be
        carefully constructed to avoid the infringement of
        individual privacy that could potentially result from the
        overzealous deployment or misuse of this Internet-
        based technology. No authoritative commentators
        today champion the dismantlement of the Internet itself
        because of the plague of privacy violations that this
        global machine has unleashed upon humanity.
        However, prudent development of the Internet might
        have mitigated this pernicious consequence through
        proper regulation of encrypted communications.
        Fortunately, the PerpTrac system operates based on
        monitoring unencrypted communications so that the
        potential for privacy violations does not approach the
        scale of that of the Internet itself. Nevertheless, the
        manufacturer of the PerpTrac may need to modify
        certain elements of the physical security service in
        order to address privacy concerns that personal liberty
        advocates may raise in the future.
        Some of the PerpTrac’s adjunct features and linked
        external services may require such modifications. The
        Private Eye app, public blacklists and the suggested link
        to a future externally operated MAC-address look-up
        service may be limited or altogether excised by the
        manufacturer in order to avoid the appearance of
        privacy violations. Prudent regulation of the Private
        Eye app and public blacklists by the PerpTrac
        management could alone satisfy reasonable privacy
        concerns about these features. The proposed MAC-
        address look-up service constitutes an externally
        operated resource such that the decision to publish this
        digital phone book would be a choice belonging to
        parties outside of the PerpTrac management team.
        Ultimately, this linked database may only allow
        password-protected access by law enforcement
        officials, similar to archives of the departments of motor
        vehicles.
        </p>

        Notwithstanding these adjunct features and linked
        external services, the PerpTrac system fundamentally
        constitutes a technology for monitoring unencrypted
        “header” packets of radio transmissions broadcasted
        by mobile phones. Since there exists no reasonable
        expectation of privacy for these forms of unencrypted
        communications that average citizens can easily
        receive, PerpTrac complies with existing privacy laws
        and ethical standards. Similarly, an individual could
        not reasonably expect to keep private plaintext
        communications contained within mass emails accessed
        by law enforcement agencies, nor would vocalized
        messages announced to crowds in speeches over
        loudspeakers or radio transmission stations enjoy any
        generally accepted mantle of confidentiality. Postings of
        personal information on Facebook routinely circulate to
        employers evaluating employees or job applicants. Just
        as frequently, electronic monitors track individuals
        either physically or by camera in order to gather
        information on the subjects of surveillance. Extending
        from the age of Big Data back to the era of America’s
        Founding Fathers, the reasonable free-flow of private
        data has been a fixture of human society. From the U.S.
        constitution to today’s Internet regulations,
        unencrypted communications broadcasts have never
        been considered personal information protected by
        privacy laws.

        In the spectrum of mobile-device tracking services,
        PerpTrac stands alongside valuable public utilities such
        as street traffic monitoring. The potential to reduce
        dramatically general crime as well as Al Qaeda-related
        terrorism in the developed world distinguishes
        PerpTrac as one of the most invaluable such services.
        Employing similar quasi-identifying data and locational
        tracking for a purely private endeavor, a growing
        number of large retail stores utilize mobile-phone
        tracking technology to generate marketing research
        that enhances corporate profits. More invasive
        personal-data mining embedded in most popular
        websites and smart phones aims to harvest a maximum
        amount of private information about users for sale to
        corporations, some of which – like Big Tobacco, Big Oil
        and Big Guns – routinely engage in unrestricted and
        unrestrained use of such data on an unprecedented
        scale in pursuit of corporate profits. On the other end of
        the corporate spectrum, PerpTrac represents a logical
        and ethical extension of the Internet age based not on
        the breaching of restricted databases nor the
        endangerment of public welfare, but rather on the
        lawful accumulation of unencrypted header data from
        radio transmissions in the service of law enforcement.
        Privacy concerns over PerpTrac do not involve
        balancing access to personal data against the societal
        benefits of enhanced information security. In fact, the
        inability of the average citizen to obtain quickly and
        easily the identity of a phone’s owner based on the
        device’s MAC address or TMSI serial number
        characterizes the PerpTrac’s mobile device tracking
        technology as analogous to a license plate number.
        Broadcasted in plaintext for anyone in the vicinity to
        read, the alphanumeric code serves as a tool for law
        enforcement to identify criminals by accessing a
        restricted database that links the number to the
        machine’s owner’s identity. In fact, the MAC address is
        even more anonymous than a license plate because
        police can more easily associate a license plate to the
        car’s owner by accessing readily linked DMV databases
        than they can a MAC to a phone’s owner, which requires
        a search warrant or other judicial process to query the
        databases of network card manufacturers, phone
        manufacturers and wireless service providers. From
        license plates to fingerprints to faces, society freely
        permits law enforcement agencies to identify average
        citizens by referencing restricted databases that
        associate individuals to such information acquired from
        license-plate scanners, fingerprint-extraction forensics
        and facial-recognition cameras.
        </p>
        <p>
        Absent the involvement of police, a license plate
        number serves as a marker by which citizens can
        blacklist a problematic driver without actually
        ascertaining the person’s identity, or alternatively,
        monitor a previously identified person for unwanted
        encroachment. In rare cases, a measure of
        extraordinary effort and luck can allow an observer of a
        license plate to track the car to the owner’s residence
        and thereby obtain the driver’s identity, just as an
        observer of a MAC address can either physically or
        digitally track an individual in order to associate the
        MAC to a personal identity. Likewise, a troublesome
        driver can switch his registered license plate with an
        unregistered plate in order to visually broadcast a false
        coded identification number, just as a criminal can
        falsify his broadcasted MAC address in order to obscure
        his identity from a police investigation. However, the
        practical utility of license plates, like MAC addresses
        and TMSI’s, to the orderly functioning of society
        requires the ubiquitous deployment of these coded
        identification numbers. Unlike the data contained in
        phone books and Facebook posts, MAC addresses and
        TMSI’s represent quasi-anonymous information that
        average citizens cannot easily associate to a personal
        identity.
        </p>
        <p>
        Granted a privilege not bestowed on the owners of cars
        with registered license plates, owners of wireless
        devices have the ability to limit the dissemination of
        both personal MAC addresses and private information
        over the Internet in order to prevent association of the
        MAC’s to the corresponding private data by unwanted
        third parties. Whereas the databases associating
        transient TMSI’s to personal identities reside in the
        protection of wireless service providers, the permanent
        status of a MAC address’s association with a wireless
        device allows third-party data collectors the
        opportunity to gather linkages to a MAC address over
        time that can identify the device’s owner. By disabling a
        phone’s Wi-Fi and Bluetooth discovery functions when
        not in use, the owner can diminish the likelihood that
        third parties will identify him based on his broadcasts
        of unencrypted header data from these network
        interfaces. Temporarily disabling the locational GPS
        function and permanently disabling statistical data
        collection apps like CallerIQ on a phone can further
        decrease the flow of personal information to third-party
        personal data vendors. Similarly, employing web-
        browsing privacy features that block ubiquitous data-
        mining programs, or avoiding the voluntary submission
        of personal data to companies, can also limit the ability
        of third parties to collect and utilize private
        information. However, as demonstrated by the
        ubiquitous listings of home addresses arranged
        alphabetically by peoples’ names in regularly updated
        phone books, the inherent openness of Western
        civilization by default limits the scope of the protection
        for an individual’s privacy. Society can only hope for
        systems like PerpTrac that curbs the extent and
        application of personal-data mining while providing an
        invaluable public service.
